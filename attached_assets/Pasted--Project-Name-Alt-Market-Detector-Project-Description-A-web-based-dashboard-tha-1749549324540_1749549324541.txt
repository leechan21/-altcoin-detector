📌 Project Name: 알트장 감지기 (Alt Market Detector)

📌 Project Description:
A web-based dashboard that tracks real-time Binance USDⓈ‑M Futures market data, detects high-momentum altcoins based on 24h price change and 15-minute volatility, and alerts the user when specific trading conditions are met (ex: step-up pattern, 15m volatility ≥ 2%, etc). Built for a trader following a volatility + breakout-based entry strategy.

📌 Target Platform:
Web (responsive, usable on both desktop and mobile)

📌 Operating Environment:
Online only — connects to Binance API in real-time

📌 Hosting:
Run on Replit for development; final deployment can be done via Vercel or Netlify

📌 Interface Style:
- Dark theme
- Minimalist
- Trading dashboard feel
- Korean labels (UI should be in Korean)

📌 Example Applications:
- Binance desktop UI
- CoinGlass "Top Gainers"
- Richan Trader entry detection strategy (based on volatility and candle step-up patterns)

📌 Expected Outputs:
- Top 10 USDⓈ‑M altcoins by 24h % change (descending)
- For each: symbol, price change %, volume, current price
- Volatility score based on 15-minute candle highs/lows
- Pattern tag: Step-up pattern (if detected)
- Alerts if coin matches: volatility ≥ 2% + step-up candles

📌 Additional Features:
- Manual refresh button + auto-refresh every 15 sec
- Logs last updated time (UTC+0 기준으로 표시)
- Badge indicators (변동성, 계단형 등)
- Notification-ready structure (for future alerting feature)
- API key/secret securely stored in Replit secrets

📌 Language Preferences:
- Replit Agent interaction: English
- App Interface: Korean (e.g. “변동성”, “추천 코인”, “실시간 갱신”)

📌 Technical API Info:
- Use Binance Futures (USDⓈ‑M) API:
  - GET `/fapi/v1/ticker/24hr` → to get 24h % change
  - GET `/fapi/v1/klines?interval=15m` → for volatility/pattern checks

📌 Timezone Note:
Sort Change(%) using UTC+0 00:00 기준 (Binance standard)

✅ Objective:
Help the user visually and programmatically detect when a coin meets high volatility breakout criteria based on Binance data in real time, to assist in timing entry for trading strategies.
